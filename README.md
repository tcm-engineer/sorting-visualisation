A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that organises items of a list in a certain order. 
Sorting algorithms provide the basis for many computer science theories and it is still 
an open research area. It is an important area of discussion within computer science to 
deduce the most efficient way of sorting a list for a given scenario. This website gives
a visualisation of how five of the most popular sorting algorithms operate by displaying 
their step-by-step procedure for sorting a set of random numbers into ascending order.
